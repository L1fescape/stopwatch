## Notes

This was made for fun just because it was an idea that popped into my head and I wanted to figure out how to do it. This project introduced me to [Readline](https://nodejs.org/api/readline.html) and [AbortController](https://developer.mozilla.org/en-US/docs/Web/API/AbortController), APIs I had heard about but had no experience with until now.
